# AB Testing
This is a collection of AB testing methodologies and case studies.


## Project 1: Analyze_AB_testing_Result
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification. 

**Project Objective:**
- An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to increase the number of "converted" users - users who make purchases on the website.

- The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test on their new and old websites and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

**Analytical Scope:**
- Sampling simulation and visulization
- Inferential Statistics: t-test, z-score and p-value
- Logistic regression

**Data:**
- ab_data.csv
- countries.csv

**Document:**
- Jupyter notebook: [Analyze_AB_Test_Results.ipynb](https://github.com/sohao0819/analyze_ab_test_result/blob/master/Analyze_AB_Test_Results.ipynb)

## Project 2: AB Testing Using Chi-square
This is a walk through of the tutorial on Chi-squared testing, based on randomly generated demographic data. 

**Analytical Scope:**
- Chi-squared testing (one-dimensional table)
- Chi-squared testing of independence (two-dimensional table)

**Document:**
- Jupyter notebook: [Chi-squared_ab_testing.ipynb](https://github.com/sohao0819/ab_testing/blob/master/2.%20Chi-squared_ab_testing.ipynb)

## Project 3: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
This is a walk through of the tutorial on ANOVA testing, based on randomly generated demographic data. 

**Analytical Scope:**
- One-way ANOVA
- Post-hoc testing 
- Bonferroni correction
- Tukey test

**Document:**
- Jupyter notebook: [Analysis_of_Variance (ANOVA).ipynb](https://github.com/sohao0819/ab_testing/blob/master/3.%20Analysis_of_Variance%20(ANOVA).ipynb)
